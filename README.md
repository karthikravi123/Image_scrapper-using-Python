# Image_scrapper_with_selenium-using-Python
Scrapping n number of images of any animals from google website using python for purpose of deep learning and computer vision

Problem Statement

Our objective is to fetch the image data for our deep learning model. That could be anything like Cat and Dog Image classification or classification of 

Superheroes by using Images. All these problems required a lot of data. Sometimes we have that, sometimes we do not. So in that case we can easily gather the data 

from any website using web scraping.


What is image scraping?

Image scraping is a subset of the web scraping technology. While web scraping deals with all forms of web data extraction, image scraping only focuses on the 

media  side – images, videos, audio, and so on.

Selenium ?

Selenium is an open-source web-based automation tool. Selenium primarily used for testing in the industry but It can also be used for web scraping. We’ll use the 

Chrome browser but you can try on any browser, It’s almost the same. Selenium Python bindings provide a simple API to write functional/acceptance tests using 

Selenium WebDriver. Through Selenium Python API you can access all functionalities of Selenium WebDriver in an intuitive way.

Selenium Python bindings provide a convenient API to access Selenium WebDrivers like Firefox, Ie, Chrome, Remote, etc. The currently supported Python versions are 

3.5 and above
